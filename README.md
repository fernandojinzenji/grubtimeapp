Hackaton PoC - April 26th, 2019

Team Members:
Fernando Jinzenji
Brandon McKay

Feature Name:
GrubTime app


Describe what your feature is.
Replace current lunch token process.


Why did you decide to work on this feature?
I usually get myself forgetting about picking up lunch tokens every day. Having a mobile app to improve this process would make things much easier for all Tractionites (in my opinion).


What impact will it have for our customers if put into production?
Not for customers, but probably would make all Tractionitesâ€™ lifes better.


What would still need to be done on your feature to get it into production?
Check firebase permissions (free tier?)
Add validations
Change data structure for daily reset
Admin mode
Send app for review (App Store/Google Play)
